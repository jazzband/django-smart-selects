All versions of django-smart-selects prior to version 1.2.8 are vulnerable to an XSS attack as detailed in [issue 171](https://github.com/digi604/django-smart-selects/issues/171#issuecomment-276774103). As a result, all previous versions have been removed from PyPI to prevent users from installing insecure versions. All users are urged to upgrade as soon as possible.

- [ ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.

- [ ] I have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case.
